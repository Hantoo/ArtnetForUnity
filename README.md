# ArtnetForUnity

## What is this? - And why another Artnet Lib?
This is a project to implement Art-Net4 into Unity. I have used alot of different artnet libaries for Unity before and have not found one which has been really nice to use.

Image above shows the UI panel, found under Artnet > General Settings. From here you can choose the NIC that Art-Net uses as well as the Art-Net complient nodes found on the network.
The nodes status update every 4 seconds.
